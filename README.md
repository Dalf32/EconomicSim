EconomicSim
===========
This is a simulation of a simple economic market wherein agents may trade commodities at market-determined prices. Agents roles (read: professions) and Commodities are specified in JSON and parsed by the simulator.
This is based on the work of Jonathon Doran and Ian Parberry from their 2010 paper: Emergent Economies and Role Playing Games (http://larc.unt.edu/techreports/LARC-2010-03.pdf). This is also based in part on the subsequent work of Lars Ducet and his BazaarBot project (http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/LarsDoucet/20130603/193491/BazaarBot_An_OpenSource_Economics_Engine.php).

The initial goal is to reproduce the aforementioned previous work, but I hope to expand on it and come up with a much more rich simulation.
